# Sassy brunch minimal is a quick minimal skeleton for any webapp.
A minimalistic implementation of brunch with sass that includes a few extras: coffeescript, bootstrap3, underscore, bourbon, font-awesome and jquery.

* Inspired by (and some code from) [brunch-with-sass](https://github.com/stefanvermaas/brunch-with-sass)

## Installation
Clone this repo manually with Git or use `brunch new http://github.com/bradens/sassy-brunch-minimal`.
